# FlaresThatWork
Fork of FlaresThatWork with changes for 10.x compatibility.

FlaresThatWork provides buttons and keybinds for raid flare world markers that never stop working mid-session.

## Why this flare addon?
Many other flare addons will stop working for no apparent reason during play, because many forms of UI taint break the original flaring API. This addon uses the new flare API introduced in 4.3, which continues to work no matter what.

## Usage Instructions
- Install as usual.
- Flare window will appear when you have permission to flare (must be in a party or a raid with assist).
- Click any symbol to toss that flare, or the clear button to clear all flares.
- Alt-drag the frame to move it.
- Shift-drag the frame to re-size it.
- Keybinds for flares are available in the blizzard keybind menu
